## Overview

I started this project several years ago as a way of exploring the clinical trial data for patterns, in support of a self-learning activity on the topic of machine learning.

You can read a bit of the background about how that clinical trial data is made available [here](docs/ctgov-aact-ctti.md).

I wrote a few articles to record the trajectory of that learning, which you can find at: <https://sourcepatch.blogspot.com/search/label/aact>.

This article, in particular, illustrates the first motivation for the project:

### Disclaimer

Given the time I have for this project, the work is more focused on the technical building blocks than on the disciplined statistical science you will see in papers like ["Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters"](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524).
