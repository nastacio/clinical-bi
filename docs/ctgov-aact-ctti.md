# Clinical Trial data

Clinical Trials are an important step in the process of developing treatment protocols for patients.

The US government maintains a database of all clinical trials (<https://clinicaltrials.gov>), completed or in progress, sponsored by US-based institutions. In some cases, it also contains information about foreign databases.

CTTI, according to its [website](https://ctti-clinicaltrials.org/who_we_are/) is a "a group of individuals and organizations that want to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical trials."

CTTI creates and maintains several tools that add value on top of <clinicaltrials.gov>, and also [shares database copies of the official database](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/), making it easier for other tool developers to interact with the data.
